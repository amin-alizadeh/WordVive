I came up with the idea of WordVive when I started studying Finnish language intensively.
I realized how difficult it is to memorize the words. Words do not _survive_ in my memory! 
I used to write words on one side of small pieces of paper and wrote the definition or translations of the words on the other side. Then I carried the papers and studied them whenver I could. This way I managed to use the small gaps of time to make the most out of it and do not waste any moment.

In the era of web and technology I thought I could replace the traditional pen and paper method by something modern. So I started developing a web-based application where is available everywhere and always and is responsive so I could use it on any device.

You can simply create an account and activate your account. Then start inserting words and practice them. It is free to use and I keep adding features and polishing it up.

Please bear in mind that this is a work in progress and I develop in my free time.
